### * Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  
  We developed an android weight tracking app that seeks to provide customers with an intuitive way for tracking their weight loss goals. Through tracking weight overtime and notifying the user when they meet their goals, users can stay motivated, inform and celebrate when they reach their goals. User has the capability to add their goal weight and their current weight. Every day, user can enter their weight and see how their weight has changed overtime. This is viewed from a grid. There is also the capability for the user to update the day, so if they made a mistake, or they reweighed for that day, it can be changed. Deleting a record is also possible in the application.
